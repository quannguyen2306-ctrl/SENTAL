# SENTAL: YouTube's Videos Comment Sentiment Analysis

## An interactive sentiment analyzing dashboard for content creators

This webpage lets you analyze your audience comments on your YouTube channel using different pre-trained models from Hugging Face (huggingface.com), and a refined LLM from OpenAI models.

Use our AI Agent to help you discover insights from the video comments' sentiment and provide feedback. The Agent uses RAG to optimize the OpenAI gpt-4o-mini LLM through the book: *The YouTube Formula* by Derral Eves.
