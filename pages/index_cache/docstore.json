Literally everyone, but \nespecially brands. When I see brands that don\u2019t have a presence \non YouT ube, I think they\u2019re insane. It\u2019s unfathomable that anyone \nisn\u2019t capitalizing on the opportunity there. It\u2019s the most coveted job in \nAmerica, and with good reason. It is quite literally a gold mine.\nWhen I was a kid, I watched YouT ube all the time. It was always \nmy dream job. I didn\u2019t want to be an astronaut or a doctor\u2014I \ncouldn\u2019t envision a world where I wasn\u2019t a YouT uber. I started my \nchannel in 2012 and only got 40 subscribers my first year. Now I \nhave one of the fastest growing channels in the world. I gained more \nthan 15 million subscribers in 2019 alone with just over 4 billion \nvideo views. And it\u2019s still growing every day.\nIf you are just getting started on YouT ube, do not expect to pull \nany type of viewership in your first year. If this isn\u2019t something you \ncan accept, don\u2019t start. But if you can, then you need to do this: make \n100 videos. It doesn\u2019t matter what they are because they will be ter-\nrible, but do something you like doing. Your first 10 videos will be \ngarbage. Then make 10 more. These will also be garbage, and so will \nthe next 10. But eventually, things will start to improve. You\u2019ll get \nbetter little by little. The best way to improve your content is to make \ncontent and see what people like.\nThen you\u2019ll notice something with your 101st video. It will be in \na whole different league from your first video. You will still be a long \nway from good content, but it will be better than your first video was.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1613, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7b0dc596-eb2a-403e-9d44-c7eebe61e0db": {"__data__": {"id_": "7b0dc596-eb2a-403e-9d44-c7eebe61e0db", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "xiv", "file_name": "pdfcoffee.com-the-youtube-formula-by-derral-eve.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/nguyenhoangquan/Documents/gate_sental/SENTAL/sental_app/app/streamlit_app/pages/data/pdfcoffee.com-the-youtube-formula-by-derral-eve.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5652085, "creation_date": "2024-10-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "17d26fd5-274b-41ff-84cb-f23861da1f19", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "xiv", "file_name": "pdfcoffee.com-the-youtube-formula-by-derral-eve.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/nguyenhoangquan/Documents/gate_sental/SENTAL/sental_app/app/streamlit_app/pages/data/pdfcoffee.com-the-youtube-formula-by-derral-eve.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5652085, "creation_date": "2024-10-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-22"}, "hash": "2d75b4b439073466dafdececa660f8d5796d522a847fd387ad59b69bdba396f1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "xiv ForEword\nIt took me hundreds of videos over several years before I got good at \nit. I had been making YouT ube videos for two years and still didn\u2019t \nmake good quality videos, even though I thought they were good at \nthe time. I was like so many creators: I thought the algorithm hated \nme because I wasn\u2019t getting subscribers and views. But in reality, my \ncontent wasn\u2019t good enough. In fact, my videos were horrible, like \nmost YouT ube videos are. Most YouT ubers have their priorities back-\nward. They spend all their time thinking about the algorithm in their \nfirst hundred videos when they should really be thinking about how \nto make better content geared toward the viewer.\nUnless you\u2019re the rare YouT uber who has created content profes-\nsionally, you\u2019re probably average (at best) at making content. You \ndon\u2019t go from entertaining nobody to entertaining millions in a \nday. It\u2019s hard work and a slow progressive workup, and it should be. \nBecause if you got millions of viewers overnight, you wouldn\u2019t know \nhow to handle them.\nEvery video is your competitor, so you have to keep putting \nin the effort to keep your content relevant and competitive. View-\ners have to pick between videos every time they go to YouT ube, and \nthey\u2019ll choose the better video without a second thought. Make your \nvideo the better video.\nIf a video from your channel from six months ago doesn\u2019t make \nyou want to barf because of how much better you are at making \ncontent now, you\u2019re doing it wrong. I can\u2019t even stand watching my \nvideos from six months ago because I am so much better at making \ncontent now. I can see how bad my old videos are. They could have \nbeen so much better! I\u2019m depressed even thinking about those videos.\nThere is a huge opportunity on YouT ube for brands. If every \nbrand knew what I know, they could get a hundred times the viewer-\nship they get on television for the same cost. They should be giving \ncreators like me their advertising budget to make YouT ube videos \naround their brand. I\u2019ll give you an example.

Or I could make \na video called, \u201cI Filled My Friend\u2019s House with a Million Cans of \nCoca-Cola.\u201d These are both banger ideas that would get a ton of \nviews if done right. (This was free, Coca-Cola; next time you can pay \nme, lol.) Videos like these could lead to millions upon millions more \nreturn than TV-spends, and it\u2019s exponentially cheaper. And seriously, \nwho really watches TV commercials anyway. Everyone picks up their \nphones during commercials.\nIf brands want to get real visibility, they have to get off of TV. \nWhat do you think people do\u2014especially anyone under the age of \n30\u2014when the ads start rolling on TV? They pull out their phones \nand quit paying attention! They\u2019re not watching your commercial! \nTheir attention has been moved to T witter. SnapChat. YouT ube. Tik-\nTok. T weets spike during TV commercials. And people don\u2019t put their \nphones down until the commercials are over and their show or sport-\ning event comes back on. Three times fewer people skip a brand deal \non YouT ube than they do on TV, because people are usually watching \nfrom their phones. They don\u2019t have a second phone to grab when they \ncome across an ad or brand deal on YouT ube, so they watch it. And \nthey\u2019re watching a YouT uber they watch all the time, so they are also \nless likely to skip because they trust these YouT ubers.\nI have more eyeballs on my content every week than the Super \nBowl. And I have a personal connection with my viewers who have \nbuilt trust in me. This audience trust value is worth so much more \nthan an impersonal celebrity or athlete appearance in a TV commer-\ncial. Brands shell out more than $5 million for 30 seconds crammed \nin with a bunch of other ads during the Super Bowl.

I wanted to sell them a five-page website design package \nfor $299. I started cold calling these businesses with my offer. After \nspending a week calling every business card that I had designed, there \nwere only two takers out of 200 calls. Selling over the phone was dif-\nficult; telemarketing wasn\u2019t for me.\nI needed a new plan, so I refocused on the problem. I analyzed \nmy talking points, learning from my telemarketing experience. I \ndevised a new strategy that would take the process from a cold call \nto a warm lead, but it meant I needed to meet with these people in \nperson. I asked Chuck if I could hand deliver the completed business \ncards to these businesses and offer my further services for ads and \nwebsites. He gave me the thumbs up and go-ahead, which landed me \nthe opportunity to meet face-to-face with people who could be poten-\ntial clients for my own business. These were the perfect candidates for \nbusinesses that needed a web designer.\nWhen I\u2019d present the finished cards to the owner or manager of \nthe business, they were always impressed with the quality of the card. \nWe didn\u2019t do simple cards; we printed in quality full-color graph-\nics with all the bells and whistles of a premium business card, which \nwas uncommon then. As soon as I saw the moment of excitement \nor approval of the product, I\u2019d pounce. Here was my window to get \na new client!

Ideas were being tossed around for websites, apps, and \nplatforms that could possibly bring in a lot of money and transform \nthe world into a digital money-making giant. Three PayPal employ-\nees, Jawed Karim, Chad Hurley, and Steven Chen, were some of these \nidea generators.

On April 23, they \nuploaded YouT ube\u2019s first video called \u201cMe at the zoo.\u201d It was 19 \nseconds of Karim at the San Diego Zoo talking about the elephants. \nIf you go and watch it now, you\u2019ll laugh because you know he was \ntrying to get the website to be a place to find a date, and he makes an \ninnuendo about the anatomy of the elephant. The video was actually \npretty good quality for nonprofessionals at the time.\nNow that they had the ball rolling and the servers going, these \nguys needed active website users. Who was the demographic of people \nlooking for love? College-age students.

Who wouldn\u2019t want unlimited access to their favorite \nbands for exactly zero dollars? Well, I guess not quite everyone was a \nNapster fan . . . namely, anyone who should be making money from \nmusic sales.\nIf you don\u2019t know the rest of the story, I bet you can guess what \nhappened next. Lawsuits. Shut down. No surprises here. Actually, \njust before Napster was created, Bill Clinton, then-president of the \nUnited States, had signed the Digital Millennium Copyright Act \n(DMCA) into law in 1998. The DMCA has regulated digital copy-\nright issues and reinforced offender penalties ever since. (However, \nwebsites hosted outside the US are regulated by the United Nations \nWorld Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO).) What happened \nwith Napster set the stage for media sharing regulation from that \npoint forward.\nYouT ube could have looked at companies like Napster as exam-\nples of what not to do, and implemented their Content ID system \nfrom the time they opened up shop in 2005, but they didn\u2019t. In \nMarch 2007, a little company called Viacom, along with several \nothers, sued Google and YouT ube for $1 billion worth of copyright \ninfringement issues. Reuters reported that YouT ube was only taking \ncopyrighted content off the site after a copyright owner had requested \nit, but there was nothing being done on the front end to prevent \nthat content from being uploaded to begin with. Further, the lawsuit \nclaimed that YouT ube knowingly let this happen because they were \nmaking money on all that content.\nThe Content ID system wouldn\u2019t be implemented until 2007, \nthe beta in June and full rollout in December. The ID system would \nattach a unique \u201cdigital fingerprint\u201d to new uploaded content. Con-\ntent could then be tracked and measured against already existing \ncopyrighted content so YouT ube could catch infractions.\nNow that the law had been involved, YouT ube had to settle some \nthings for copyright holders.

It operates a program called Cloud Vision (CV).  \nCV uses optical character recognition (OCR) and image recognition  \nto determine lots of things about a video based on what it finds in \nthe thumbnail. It takes points from each image in the thumbnail \nand, using billions of data points already in the system, recognizes \nthose images, and feeds that information back into the algorithm. \nFor example, a thumbnail including a close-up of world-renowned \nphysicist Stephen Hawking\u2019s face is recognized as such in CV, so that \nvideo can be \u201cgrouped\u201d in the suggested feed along with every other \nvideo on YouT ube that has been tagged under the Stephen Hawking \ntopic. This is how your videos get discovered and watched.\nIn addition, CV utilizes a \u201csafety\u201d tool that determines, based \non the data it has gathered from the images in your thumbnail, if \nyour video is safe for all audiences to watch, or if it has adult themes, \nviolence, or other questionable content, and it gives a \u201cconfidence\u201d \nscore of that determination. This score also reflects how accurately \nthe content matches what the thumbnail shows.

Creators need to follow a consistent schedule with \nuploading at the right time on the right days. There is no recom-\nmended schedule for all channels everywhere. For example, a Mon-\nday, Wednesday, Friday at 8 a.m. schedule doesn\u2019t work for every \nchannel.

One day, her hus-\nband asked her why she did it, and she said it was the way her mother \nhad always done it. So the husband went to his mother-in-law and \nasked her the same question. She replied, \u201cBecause my roasting pan \nwas too small to fit a whole pot roast.\u201d The wife\u2019s roasting pan was big \nenough to fit an entire pot roast all along, and she had been doing the \ntask unnecessarily for years (not to mention she was wasting perfectly \ngood meat).\nSimilarly, creators expend a lot of wasted energy when they don\u2019t \nknow there is a better way. For example, there was a time on You-\nT ube when there was a glitch in the scheduling feature, so channel \nsubscribers weren\u2019t getting notified about new scheduled uploads. \nCreators started uploading manually because they thought it was \nthe only way to get around the problem. The glitch was fixed, but a \nlot of creators continued to think it was broken. They believed this \nfor years and were slaves to the clock.

But she did take \nthe class, and what she discovered was that quilting took an incred-\nible amount of creativity. She was hooked. Jenny was a piecer, which \nmeans that she put the pieces together for the top layer of the quilt. \nTo finish the quilt, you needed a longarm machine that would put \nthe quilt top, fluffy insides, and quilt backing together.

Go back and read about how Jeffrey Harmon, a poor \ncollege student at the time, took a product from near death to inter-\nnational distribution and millions in evergreen sales.  Orabrush\u2019s \ninventor, \u201cDr. Bob\u201d Wagstaff, had tried many ways to sell his \ntongue-cleaning brush, but nothing had worked. When a company \nis spending two dollars to make one, they get to a point where they \nhave two options: quit, or try something totally new. Wagstaff chose \noption two and gave this marketing student the reins. YouT ube was \ntotally new, and Jeffrey wanted to try using it to help Dr. Bob save \nhis invention. Advertisers weren\u2019t on YouT ube yet; it was a rudimen-\ntary platform to buy ads to send traffic to. This is why it was such \na huge opportunity: there was nobody to compete with yet. Jeffrey \nenlisted the help of fellow amateur creators he knew to help him \nmake a video for Orabrush for a few hundred dollars, and he put \nit online.\nJeffrey paid a penny per ad view\u2014a crazy cheap amount by \ntoday\u2019s standards\u2014and Orabrush started making big money. The ad \nplatform had increased sales percentages by the thousands.

Because of one guy! He had \nbeen buying up all the inventory in ad views, and it was like printing \nhis own money. YouT ube caught on, and they wanted to control the \nmoney flow. (I like to call this moment in YouT ube history the Jeffrey \nHarmon Effect. Oh, the power!)\nIn the ad\u2019s first month, Orabrush made $30,000. The second \nmonth saw $70,000 in revenue.

There \nwere some elements that were needed to make it happen in real time \nand editing wouldn\u2019t work. And he couldn\u2019t refilm the video because \nhe couldn\u2019t cut open and destroy another expensive watch. Dan did \nwhat he could and uploaded the video to his channel, and guess \nwhat? His intuition was spot on. The video underperformed exactly \nlike he said it would.\nHow did Dan know that his audience wouldn\u2019t respond to this \nvideo? Does Dan have some freakish sixth sense?\nI have found that the most successful creators have great intuition \nabout what will work and what won\u2019t. They know their audience so \nwell that they can kind of predict the outcome in their head. They \nknow which video will become a \u201cbanger\u201d and which won\u2019t.\nThis kind of YouT ube Sixth Sense can be learned, and it comes \nfrom analyzing successful content and knowing your audience. To \nanalyze content, you have to put it under a microscope and figure out \nevery moving part. Data analysis will force you to move past biases \nand assumptions that can cloud judgment and lead to poor decision \nmaking.

I did website \nranking on Internet directories and search engines. As I was learn-\ning how to do Internet marketing in the 1990s, I had learned a lot \nabout search engines and SEO. Basically, I was good at keyword \nstuffing and looking for exploits. The Internet was dumb back \nthen, so this worked. T raditionally, search engines had been done \nby submitting to a directory, but Google changed the way every-\nthing was discovered by spidering the results and then ranking in \nsearch results.

Every time I thought I was on top, Google \nkept doing updates to plug the holes and figure out Internet traffic, \nand they would give every update a cutesy animal name: the Panda \nupdate, the Penguin update, and so on. I hated these updates because \nthey made my job and life so difficult. Then I would be back on that \ncycle, looking for any hack or strategy to get those websites to rank. \nAll I could think about was the algorithm. This was a vicious cycle, \nand something had to give. What gave? I gave. I finally realized that I \nhad to change the way I did things so that I could operate in line with \nGoogle\u2019s goals. Once I did that, I succeeded every time.\nThis is my plea to you not to hate the YouT ube algorithm.

I asked \nDevin how many law students there were in the United States at any \ngiven time, and he said around a hundred thousand, so I helped him \nunderstand that he had reached the threshold of market penetration \nwith what he was doing, and if he wanted to grow past that, he had to \nextend his reach.\nDevin\u2019s audience was maxed out with the kind of content that \nhe was creating, and if he wanted to get a bigger audience, he had to \nchange his content to reach people outside of the law student demo-\ngraphic. I asked him to reiterate why he wanted to make videos in \nthe first place, and he said he just wanted to share his passion for the \nlaw and help people understand law better. So the follow-up question \nwas: How can you help more people outside of law school understand \nthe law? The answer we came up with was to use law-related TV \nshows and movies a mainstream audience already enjoyed watching \nand deconstruct them in a \u201cReal Lawyer Reacts to . . .\u201d format. He \nalready had one video in this format, but he needed to create more in \nthis series. He also created an original true crime special. He was still \nreaching his original viewer, but he had found a way to appeal to a \npop culture viewer as well. Legal Eagle now has more than a million \nsubscribers and a hundred million views.

I thought \nit would be easy to do because it would be people just like us. Dal-\nlas knew we could speak the message but was more skeptical that we \ncould get people to invest.

Dallas also had a lot of experience in the space. But \nno one had ever made HBO-quality Christian productions. Texas is \none of the largest groups in online video consumerism, so we targeted \nTexas and other southern Christian areas. In other data that we had \ngathered in recon and research, we realized that Gen X and millennial \nwomen are the biggest spenders online, so our target buyer persona \nwas females aged 25 to 45. We targeted the people who were the \ncommunity, school, and church volunteers, the I-love-Jesus type.\nFor our lockdown marketing session, we got ourselves an Airbnb, \nordered in food, and got down to business. We laser-focused on who \nour audience was. We defined the path of how we would get from \nwhere we were to our end goal. We had to figure out how we would \nraise the money and how we would find the army of people who \nwould resonate with our content and promote it to the world.\nWe had seed money with the intent of crowdfunding to reach the \nneeds of this project. At the time, Mystery Science Theater 3,000 and \nVeronica Mars were the highest grossing crowdfunded projects with \ndevout, cult followings. So we made a goal to surpass these projects \nand become the #1 crowdfunded project in the history of movies and \ntelevision. The goal was $10 million.

Its messaging inspires, educates, shocks, and changes peo-\nple to the core. When we talk about \u201ccontent\u201d on YouT ube, one of \nthe biggest mistakes people make is thinking that \u201ccontent\u201d equals \n\u201cvideo.\u201d Video is definitely a part of it, but content also includes \nthe title, thumbnail, and other metadata. Your video should be \ndone well, sure, but you must give equal\u2014if not more\u2014attention \nto your video\u2019s title and thumbnail, because they are the make-or-\nbreak factors when a viewer is deciding whether they will click and \nwatch. You will learn in Chapter 15 how to make a good title and \nthumbnail.\nAfter you get them to click, you get to do the fun part: make \nthe video! Scratch that: make a good video. You have to know \nwhat makes a good video in order to make a good video. It\u2019s sim-\nple circular logic, but it works. Like when Chris Farley says in the \nclassic SNL skit, \u201cYou\u2019ll have plenty of time to live in a van down \nby the river when you\u2019re living in a van down by the river.\u201d We hear \nyou, Farley.

And it works for kids, millennials, and boomers alike. \nIt\u2019s called a story arc, and the best way for me to break it down for \nyou is to refer to an episode of one of TV\u2019s most successful series, \nSeinfeld.

His storyline is clear, his hook is bold and \nsimple, and his reengagements are off the charts. He zooms, pans, and \nshoots from different perspectives. He edits with continuous reen-\ngagement in mind, doing quick cuts and fast paces because he knows \nthat\u2019s what works with his audience.\nHe also keeps storylines simple.

YouT ube \nanalytics helps you break down the elements in metrics so you can \ncourse-correct. The YouT ube development team has done a great \njob here. It seems every week there is a new metric or tool added to \nsimplify their reports. I am thrilled with the robust analytical tools \nand insights.

We can break down your audience in \nyour Channel analytics to show your unique viewers, how many vid-\neos they watch, your subscriber growth or decline, when your viewers \nare on YouT ube, and how many of those viewers are subscribers who \nhave bell notifications turned on. You can see your viewers by age, \ngender, and the top countries and languages represented among them. \nSee Figures 14.1 and 14.2.\nThe second W is the Where. Your traffic source report is found \nunder the Reach tab. It will help you uncover where the viewers \nare watching your video: from within YouT ube, or from external \nsources or embeds on websites. See Figure 14.3.

The AI is really sensitive to everything \nthat viewers engage with on the platform, and it actually starts with \nan impression. An impression happens when a viewer is able to see a \ntitle and thumbnail for at least one second. This could be on the You-\nT ube Homepage, Subscription feed, in Search results, or Suggested \nfeed (Up next). If the viewer skips by the title and thumbnail quicker \nthan one second, it doesn\u2019t count as an impression. If they click, that\u2019s \nwhat records your click-through rate (CTR). An important note: the \nhigher the impressions and CTR data the better. That means You-\nT ube is recommending your video out to a more general audience. \nThe more it recommends, the more impressions you will get. The \nmore impressions you get, the lower your CTR. So don\u2019t freak out \nthat your CTR percentage is dropping when your impressions and \nviews go up.

I knew it was a huge factor, so I continued to spend a lot of \ntime, money, and energy learning about which titles and thumbnails \nworked because this was the only way to get people to watch or buy.\nLet me give you an example of how to do this. When Jeffrey Har-\nmon, Daniel Harmon, and their team and I created the Squatty Potty \nad, we made a Google doc for title ideas and added every variation we \ncould think of. There are no \u201cdumb\u201d ideas in brainstorming, because \nanything can inspire a great title. We needed to figure out what was \ngoing to pique human curiosity and make them click. Because more \nclicks would bring us more people taking action to buy. We knew \nwe had to test our options, so we did 165 title variations to see how \nviewers responded to them. We all had our favorites, but we had to \nchoose based on the data\u2014the data doesn\u2019t lie! And we really wanted \nto get it right because we had a lot riding on this campaign. Success \nwas our only option. The best way to see which title and thumbnail \nbrought the highest CTR was to run Facebook engagement ads. We \ncreated several ads for Facebook to figure out how our target audience \nresponded, running A/B split testing on different titles and scenarios.\nInterestingly, the very first title I had come up with eventually \nbecame the final title, \u201cThis Unicorn Changed the Way I Poop,\u201d but \nit took a couple hundred dollars to know that it was the best per-\nforming title. The inspiration came from looking at a list of Daniel\u2019s \ntitles and brainstorming from there. That\u2019s the power of collabora-\ntion and brainstorming together. After selecting the titles, we needed \nto start testing thumbnails. We also took 20 different thumbnails \nand tried them with our top five title options, spent a couple hun-\ndred more dollars on additional split testing, and made our final \ndecision based on the data.

This serves as an explicit trigger in \nthumbnails because the brain has circuits devoted to faces. When my \ndaughter Ellie was four months old, I was reading a study about how \nbabies can recognize faces and emotional expressions starting at about \nthree months old. Of course, I had to put it to the test. I tested six \nfacial expressions on baby Ellie to see what emotion it produced.

Knowing how \nthe human brain reacts to images can give you a massive advantage \nwhen designing your thumbnails.\nNetflix has some of the best thumbnails on the planet. They \nspent a lot of money trying to perfect the science of grabbing viewer \nattention. I regularly browse Netflix to look at the thumbnails that \nreally grab my attention. I never click on it to watch, I only browse. It \ndrives my wife Carolyn nuts. She\u2019ll say, \u201cAre we going to watch some-\nthing, or am I going to watch you look at thumbnails all night.\u201d I\u2019m \nfascinated by what shows up. I also go to Carolyn\u2019s account and my \nkids\u2019 accounts to see what shows up differently for them. I study the \nthumbnails a lot. I even create test accounts just to see other types of \nthumbnails shown and what is recommended. In doing research for \nclients, I ask them to list 20 movies their viewers would watch, then I \nselect them on Netflix and see which recommendations and thumb-\nnails populate from Netflix\u2019s AI. This always gives me ideas of which \ncolors and image positions really connect with a demographic.\nImagine seeing 12 images flash on a screen in a fraction of a sec-\nond. Do you think you can process each image? A team of neurosci-\nentists from MIT have found that the human brain can process entire \nimages that the eye sees in as little as 13 milliseconds.\nThere is a Netflix research article called \u201cThe Power of a Picture\u201d \nthat reinforces the importance of an image to help a consumer choose \nwhat to watch. In their research, Netflix found that the artwork \nassociated with a movie accounted for more than 80% of people\u2019s \nattention while browsing. Attention given to titles was secondary and \nlasted less than two seconds. That\u2019s not a lot of time to convince with \nwords that this is what that person wants to watch.

Color blindness is widely misun-\nderstood. Many people assume it means that someone can only see in \nblack and white, but it doesn\u2019t. It means the brain can\u2019t process dif-\nferent shades of color. In the video about Cayson, his dad wanted to \nsurprise him with something, so he had him go outside on a beauti-\nful day. The sky was bright blue and the grass was a luscious green, \nbut Cayson didn\u2019t see it that way. His color-blind brain saw a blue \nor purple sky and red grass. Cayson\u2019s dad then gave him EnChroma \nglasses. These glasses allow color-blind people to see colors correctly, \nsomething Cayson had never experienced before. He put on the \nglasses, and tears started running down his face. His dad cried, too, \nboth sobbing for joy. I wish everyone could see Cayson\u2019s face. I\u2019m so \ngrateful to live in a world with color.\nIn 1665, Sir Isaac Newton was studying about light and color at \nCambridge University. He was observing how light was reflected into \nvarious colors. On a sunny day, Newton darkened his room by cover-\ning up his window with drapes, making a small hole to allow just one \nbeam of sunlight into the room. Then he held a large glass prism in \nthe beam of light. He was able to see the full color spectrum. This led \nto more prism experiments, not only by him, but by countless scien-\ntists studying color and light.\nColor plays a huge role in influencing decisions.

Viewers took the bait and clicked, but it didn\u2019t take long \nfor them to realize that the content didn\u2019t show what was advertised \nin the thumbnail. YouT ube noticed trends in the data from the new \ncustom thumbnail feature, so they started using different metrics \nto inform their Suggested video recommendations. This helped to \nminimize the clickbait problem (see Chapter 2 for more about this \nissue). Note: Clickbait can be good if your video content delivers on \nthe promise and isn\u2019t misleading the viewer.\nI watched custom thumbnails transform YouT ube.

You can do this effectively with close-ups and \ncomplex emotions on the face of the person or people in the image. \nFigure 15.8 shows some of the most common types of thumbnails on \nYouT ube.

Ask these questions: Are \nthere any objects that are too small? How about things that you can\u2019t \neasily distinguish? And do the blink test, closing your eyes and open-\ning them to see what grabs your attention first. Super Tip: I always \nwant to see how my thumbnail looks compared to other thumbnails. \nTo do a mock comparison, screenshot search results and photoshop \nyour thumbnail in with the list of results. This can be super powerful \nto see how the viewer would see your thumbnails.\nThumbnails the\u00a0Right Way\nTo do a thumbnail the right way, plan ideas before you even shoot \nthe video.

Understanding what viewers want or what they care \nabout gives you an advantage when they are making the quick deci-\nsion to click.\nMaking Clickable Titles\nTo make a clickable title you must satisfy the Why by providing value \nin the What. This is something that most creators struggle with for \nyears. It can be a major stumbling block to getting people to connect \nwith your content. I always have a brainstorming session on title ideas \nlike what we did with the Squatty Potty ad. Then I refine the title to \nmake it more compelling and clickable.\nBelow are some tips and examples on how to make titles \nmore compelling and clickable. Let\u2019s pretend I just created a new \nYouT ube channel called \u201cDerral 42.\u201d My content will be about \nspace, exploration, and the wonders of the universe, so my title \nexamples follow accordingly. (By the way, 42 is not my age! If you \nare my viewer persona, you understand my reference to 42. So, \ndon\u2019t panic.)\nUse active voice. Active voice titles are effective on YouT ube \nbecause they are clear, to the point, and can be easily understood. \nYou will see that examples in these tips use an active voice. Having \nan active voice title also creates a sense of urgency naturally. I\u2019ll talk \nabout urgency later in this list.\nBe relevant, trending, and topical. Using trends and current \nevents helps titles become candy for the right viewer. For example, \nin the summer of 2020, SpaceX was in the news for sending NASA \nastronauts to the international space station for the first time in \nnearly a decade. So if I created a video around this trending topic, my \ntitles might be:\n \u2022SpaceX Helped NASA Astronauts Become Cool Again\n \u2022Elon Musk Helped NASA Astronauts Become Cool Again", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1783, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7ceea237-f64b-42a8-b25b-ffae7fc8dfb7": {"__data__": {"id_": "7ceea237-f64b-42a8-b25b-ffae7fc8dfb7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "206", "file_name": "pdfcoffee.com-the-youtube-formula-by-derral-eve.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/nguyenhoangquan/Documents/gate_sental/SENTAL/sental_app/app/streamlit_app/pages/data/pdfcoffee.com-the-youtube-formula-by-derral-eve.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5652085, "creation_date": "2024-10-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bca823f0-f1e7-4e50-8a1e-fe5dbaf40c9c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "206", "file_name": "pdfcoffee.com-the-youtube-formula-by-derral-eve.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/nguyenhoangquan/Documents/gate_sental/SENTAL/sental_app/app/streamlit_app/pages/data/pdfcoffee.com-the-youtube-formula-by-derral-eve.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5652085, "creation_date": "2024-10-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-22"}, "hash": "31fa046a3e29f0a5ebe93658d6749cca569fd78a15f93b6b9cf40065adca86b5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "206 THE YOUTUBE FORMULA\nUse questions (both open- and closed-ended).

For monitoring how long viewers stay on your \nvideo, there is a metric called average view duration, or AVD. \nIf you have a 10-minute video and YouT ube says your AVD is \n2:30, that means on average your viewers watch 2 minutes and 30 \nseconds of your video. In case you\u2019re wondering, this is not a good \nAVD. The second metric to look at for retention is called aver-\nage view percentage, or AVP . This is the average percentage of the \nvideo that people watch before leaving. So if your AVP says 63%, \nthis means that on average your viewers watch 63% of the total \nvideo before leaving.\nAVD and AVP do not match up perfectly because of the way \npeople consume your video. For instance, I watch all videos at 2\u00d7 \nspeed. So on a 10:00 video, my AVD would be 5:00, but my AVP \nwould be 100%. For long-term channel growth, these two met-\nrics are key. The title and thumbnail will get you views, but AVD \nand AVP will get you Watch time and the right kind of audience. \nThe longer you can keep viewers watching the more engaged they \nbecome, which turns into a loyal audience. The goal is to balance \nthese two metrics and increase them together. YouT ube provides \nmultiple metrics to help with this. Take a look at Figures 16.1 \nthrough 16.3 as an explanation.\nThe \u201chockey stick\u201d effect shown in Figure 16.1 happens when \nviewers come on and quickly leave.

There isn\u2019t enough time, \nmoney, or resources. The trick is to create content gradually and build \nan engaging library over time. That might sound daunting with a \ntraditional production mind-set as a reference point. But to produce \nat scale requires rethinking that huge production process. You don\u2019t \nneed a fancy production set and equipment to scale; in fact, you liter-\nally can use your smartphone and be successful if you create engag-\ning content.\nCreate might just mean you make an entertaining video that \ngets people\u2019s attention. But as you consider what your audience cares \nabout and will engage with, think about the micro-moments they \nmight be experiencing. Micro-moments happen when people turn to \ntheir devices to find answers, discover new things, make decisions, be \nentertained, or buy something. You can find more on Google\u2019s guide \nto micro-moments in Chapter 11. Make content that fulfills your \nviewers\u2019 needs, whether that means you entertain, inform, inspire, \nanswer, and/or sell. Also, think of using video for storymaking that \nviewers become a part of rather than telling them a story without \nengagement.\nWith millions of channels, the call to \u201cbe different\u201d might sound \nlike a joke. It can feel crowded on YouT ube, especially in popular con-\ntent genres. Even so, there is always a way to make your own spin and \nfigure out how to be different. For example, Kristen from the cooking \nchannel Six Sisters Stuff knows cooking channels are a dime a dozen. \nThere are probably millions of cooking channels.

He knew the video \nwould be more interesting if he had a real soccer player kicking \nthe balls around, so he collaborated with another YouT ube creator, \nGarrett Gee, who was a former collegiate soccer player. Garrett \nhad lived in Russia, which happened to be where the World Cup \nwas occurring that year, so he also had some interesting, relevant \ncultural input.

I give several examples with \nBrooklyn and Bailey McKnight, identical twin vloggers who do some \nsuccessful collaborations with BYUtv\u2019s Studio C sketch comedy chan-\nnel. Their paired strategy got Studio C, a small channel at the time, a \nlot of exposure and a lot of money. Of course, it helped Brooklyn and \nBailey, too.

Well, \nto get the most out of this exercise, you have to go way beyond FAQs. \nSo after he had his 40 down, I had him think about every possible \nquestion he had ever been asked and had him add them all to his list. \nHe ended up with more than 250 questions. Now you can sort your \nlist according to which questions come up the most. Then you are \nready to create content that answers all of the questions your potential \nviewer might ask in Search, giving the most asked questions priority. \nIf your content pops up at the top of the results, viewers are more \nlikely to click on your video, and you\u2019re more likely to have gained \nanother viewer. You also need to consider that YouT ube is owned by \nGoogle, so your content needs to show up in a Google search as well, \nbecause your traffic could come from there.\nNext, I want you to make a list of questions that people should \nask you. These are your SAQs, or should ask questions. Your SAQs \nand FAQs should interweave. How? Let\u2019s say you create a video to \nanswer one of your frequently asked questions. In this video, you also \nshould bring in an SAQ that relates to the FAQ at hand. This strat-\negy satisfies your viewer\u2019s curiosity, gives them even more than what \nthey came for, and still provides a smooth viewing experience that is \ndigestible and brings value. Further, another great strategy to use here \nis to create another video (or two or three . . . ) with the same line \nof questions in mind. Then you can recommend they watch it next, \neither verbally or with an end card or both. There\u2019s also a higher prob-\nability that YouT ube might put it in the Suggested videos. This is a \ngreat way to keep the viewer engaged and watching more of your con-\ntent or buying your products.

The T rending tab features \ngeo-specific popular topics that have a broader appeal. Take different \napproaches to your content strategy based on which place your traffic \nis coming from. Each traffic source\u2019s algorithm has indicators to know \nwhen content is good and when it is bad. YouT ube takes the videos \nthat indicate \u201cgood\u201d and puts them where they will likely get the \nbest response.\nSome creators think releasing as much content as possible gives \nthem the best opportunity to be seen. While this can be true in cer-\ntain situations, like for kids\u2019 content and gaming content, it can be \ndetrimental to your own content. Multiple uploads too close together \nmeans the algorithm has to pick one to push. And when it picks one, \nwhat happens to the other? T raffic jam.

Over years \nof observing and working with a lot of daily vloggers, I\u2019ve learned \nthat the most optimal Browse schedule is three times a week. A lot of \nvloggers think that in order to make it big, they have to release a new \nvideo every single day. It makes sense that anyone risks burnout at \nthat rate. Lucky for them, it actually works better to have some natu-\nral breathing room between uploads, both for the viewer to have time \nto watch the content, and for YouT ube to figure out who to push the \ncontent to and what videos to suggest after that video.\nRather than trudging through an endless daily grind, figure out \nhow to tie your content together.

Another video could be \na teardown of the phone with its components exposed.

As you can see from \nthis last example, Icons can be associated with more than a place or \na company; they can stand for values, visions, and feelings. Shapes, \nsounds, smells, and tastes all can be iconic as well.

In colloquial terms, \nRitual is \u201chow we roll.\u201d People have seen what you\u2019re about, now they \nneed to see how you go about it.

It\u2019s become an important Ritual for our viewers.\nWe decided to have a programming Ritual during the Covid-19 \npandemic where we offered a free episode every night for eight days. \nThen we would do a live stream at the end of every episode with \nfamiliar Rituals that kept engagement and retention. Dallas would \nwelcome the viewers, introduce the episode, tease a cast member \ninterview, show the episode, talk about interesting moments from the \nepisode, do the cast member interview, tease the next episode, and \nsign off. It became a Ritual for our viewers, who continued to grow as \nthe week went on, and we even landed on YouT ube\u2019s T rending page. \nThis was a huge deal.

It\u2019s called Sacred Words or Lexicon. Words identify us. \nWhether you speak English, Spanish, Mandarin, or Klingon, that \nlanguage identifies you as a part of a culture of speakers or citi-\nzens of a specific place. The same is true of communities in sports, \ncompanies, gaming, music, and online platforms. Patrick\u2019s favorite \nexample of Sacred Words is ordering a drink at Starbucks: iced \ngrande skinny vanilla latte. You have to know the words so they get \nyour order right. Even families have their own Sacred Words. If I \nsaid, \u201cI love you six times,\u201d or, \u201cBe of good cheer,\u201d to someone in \nmy family, it would mean something specific to us that outsiders \nwouldn\u2019t understand.\nPatrick explains that you belong to many communities all at the \nsame time. You could be a musician or a banker or an artist or a poker \nplayer . . . or you could be all of those things. You have different \nwords and associations for all of them, and you can\u2019t mix them. You \ndon\u2019t take your rock-and-roll jargon to work at the bank. When you \nget a new job you have to learn all the vocabulary and jokes and learn \nto fit in that space.\nCreed and Sacred Words can blend, so our \u201cGet used to differ-\nent\u201d Creed also belongs in The Chosen\u2019s Lexicon. People who don\u2019t \nbelong to our community don\u2019t understand what it means. Knowing \nthe right words proves that you belong. If you don\u2019t get it, you\u2019re an \noutsider. It\u2019s actually great to have outsiders\u2014when a community\u2019s \nLexicon is shared verbally or virtually or on merchandise, it allows \noutsiders the opportunity to ask what it means.

In Primal \nBranding, they are called Nonbelievers. They are the countercul-\nture to who you are, what you believe in, and what you do.

Some of our big-\ngest Nonbelievers are Christians by name but they don\u2019t agree with \nour message or delivery. We have had a lot of backlash over our \npoetic license. Some people think it should be entirely historically \naccurate according to their version of the Bible or their religion\u2019s \nteachings.\nOur team has been extremely meticulous when it comes to \nThe Chosen\u2019s storyline. We want to tell the life of Jesus Christ as it \nis found in the gospels of the Bible, but we also refer to historical \nworks and scholars and to leaders and scholars from many differ-\nent religions. We are very careful to keep our message nondenomi-\nnational. No matter how carefully we tread these waters, however, \nthere will always be haters. And we are okay with that. When people \nhate, people defend. Polarization often can feed energy into a com-\nmunity and help it thrive even more. People become more invested \nin the content when they\u2019ve defended it.

Someone \nneeds to be the voice of the community. Brands and channels that \nperform well have a defined Leader. Leaders send a rallying cry, and \nloyal followers will answer. I finally convinced Dallas to become the \nLeader or the influencer for The Chosen\u2019s community even though \nhe fought me on it for a couple of years. He conceded and went on \na live stream, asking our followers to buy merchandise. He sang his \nlittle jingle, and wouldn\u2019t you know that we had a lot of money come \nin fast. It was a powerful affirmation to Dallas that he needed to be \nthe Leader for our brand. He is our Leader in so many ways: he is \nthe director, he is the writer\u2014it just made sense that he needed to be \nour Leader. This was the trigger we needed to really grow and get our \nmessage out to the masses. Other examples of community Leaders \ninclude Bill Gates for Microsoft and Elon Musk for Tesla and SpaceX. \nThey are the face of the brand, and it totally works.\nOnce you pull these seven fundamentals together, you are able to \ncreate a narrative that people can identify with and connect to. You \ncan build a community around products and services, around per-\nsonalities or social media influencers, among coworkers or employees, \nand more.

You \nhave to get your message out to the people. Where are you going to \ndo that? What elements work on what platform? Do you tell your \nCreation Story on Facebook?

Put in the energy and time to make it great. \nThis takes more time than you realize . . . then probably more.\nUse colors to make your thumbnails really pop. Use words when \nnecessary. Use emotion, because it creates that curiosity you want in \na potential viewer. Always be honest. Your thumbnail and title need \nto actually reflect what the video is about, or you\u2019ll probably have a \nlow average view duration (AVD). Use catchy, clickable titles that \nhook humans (not robots). A good rule of thumb for titles is to be \ncatchy but concise. Put your main or primary keyword as close to \nthe front of the title as possible\u2014this helps you get ranked and sug-\ngested. Of course, your title has to be relevant.

The initial video, \u201cTop Soccer Shootout \nEver with Scott Sterling,\u201d had gone viral. I tried to encourage them \nfrom the beginning to sell merchandise, but they didn\u2019t do it.

The video, \u201cScott Ster-\nling Breaking News Update,\u201d was released almost five months after \nthe original.\nIn this video, a nosy news reporter storms into Scott Sterling\u2019s \nhospital room and begins asking him questions about his plans to \nreturn to soccer in the future. Sterling\u2019s trainer intercepts the pesky \nreporter and defends him. The video is just over two minutes long \nand includes Studio C\u2019s regular comedic pace, which makes it feel nat-\nural to their regular, ideal viewer. But 47 seconds into it, you\u2019ll see the \nfirst call to action box \u201cClick to Buy\u201d for the T-shirt. The trainer then \npulls the call to action into the script, keeping the viewer engaged by \nadding the comedic element to the CTA. They finish out the sketch, \nand at the end, the CTA box pops on screen again. The trainer adds \nsarcastic comments to the merchandise push, telling viewers not to \nbuy it for their friends and family, mentioning the quality of the fab-\nric and the reasonable price. We spent just a few thousand dollars on \nthis promotion, and we made millions in T-shirt sales.\nAs you can see, promoting with a blended strategy of organic \nreach and paid push produces the best results.

An invaluable feature that I love to use is \nthe A/B split testing. To run a split test, click on a video in your \nlibrary and add a secondary thumbnail with a subtle variation, like \nchanging a background color. It doesn\u2019t work as well if you use a \ncompletely different thumbnail variation. After the test has run its \ncourse, look at which thumbnail performed better, and more spe-\ncifically, where the traffic was coming from. Be careful not to take a \nquick glance and make a rash decision; the numbers can be deceiv-\ning if you don\u2019t look at them right. Use your brain and dig a little \ndeeper. See which traffic source is improving, and if that\u2019s your goal \nfor this specific video.\nSmall Tweaks\nWe spent a whole chapter on how you get people to click or tap on \nyour video. You have to have good titles and thumbnails. Getting \npeople to click triggers data to start feeding your metrics. Then you\u2019ll \nbe able to see how this video stacks up against your average perfor-\nmances so you\u2019ll know if you need to change something. Changing \nsomething usually means swapping out a thumbnail image first to see \nif that does the trick. If you watch your baselines after the swap and \nit doesn\u2019t fix it, then you can tweak your title and watch your base-\nlines again. If this still isn\u2019t working, you can go back and swap out \nyet another thumbnail. Don\u2019t be afraid to do this. I\u2019ve seen it happen \ntime and time again where the second or third (or sometimes fourth!) \nthumbnail finally clicks and the numbers start to climb.\nOne of my students has a channel that is really taking off.

We talked \nabout the importance of creating data relationships among their \nvideos and getting their content in the Suggested feed. We talked \nabout collaborating with other family vloggers. They made a new \nplan based on these ideas, and they committed to it. Rachel was \ndetermined to get her channel back on track, so she gave herself a \ndeadline to reestablish monetization, and she got to work making \nbetter content.\nJase and Rachel surrounded themselves with like-minded people \nand did some great collaborations. They even shared audiences, top-\nics, and upload schedules with similar family vloggers. They made \nsure their audience had good crossover data with the channels they \nchose to collaborate with so they would get the right viewers watch-\ning their content. Every Monday night for two years they did a live \nstream and played family games. They knew consistency was impor-\ntant, so they never missed a week. This was a new strategy that gave \ntheir audience a chance to connect deeper. Viewers had great com-\nments that gave them ideas for more videos, and they listened.\nAudience engagement was huge.

Now you \nknow that there are opportunities aplenty\u2014a whole world of views to \ncapture and money to make. There are countless ways to interact and \nsucceed through community, collaborations, brand deals, and more.\nAs you move forward as a creator, align your priorities and \npractices with what YouT ube wants. Put more importance on getting \nviewers to click or tap on your video, because if they don\u2019t click, they \nwon\u2019t watch.

You are an important part of \nwhy I do what I do.\nLet me tell you a quick story about our purpose:\nWhen I was 12 years old, I went camping with my grandpa \nJack. We were camping on top of a mountain by a reservoir overlook-\ning the red rocks of Zion National Park in Utah. It was the most \nbeautiful place to camp. Early in the morning, I was asleep in our \ntent when Grandpa Jack woke me before sunrise and asked me to go \nfor a walk around the reservoir with him. The calm water looked like \na sheet of glass at that early hour. It was so peaceful as the first light \nof day started to peak over the majestic mountains of Zion. Then a \nbeam of light shot over the mountains, reflecting on the water, and \nit was the most beautiful, serene moment. At that moment, Grandpa \nJack bent down and picked up a rock. With the rock in hand, he said, \n\u201cDerral, you are like this rock. You are hard headed, strong, and a lit-\ntle rough around the edges. The water is the world . . .\u201d and he threw \nthe rock into the water, shattering the glassy surface and sending rip-\nples across the reservoir. \u201cWhat you do can impact so many people,\u201d \nGrandpa Jack said. \u201cWhat impact will you have on the world? Will \nit be good, or will it be bad?\u201d And he walked away, leaving me alone \nto contemplate the life lesson he had just taught. I had been camp-\ning with my grandpa many times in my life, and he had never done \nanything like this before. It felt so out of the ordinary that it left \nme a little dumbfounded. As I said, I was only 12 years old, so the \npower of the message didn\u2019t fully hit me at the time, but it continued", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1695, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "33178e59-989d-4d1c-89eb-c6dd318b6dd9": {"__data__": {"id_": "33178e59-989d-4d1c-89eb-c6dd318b6dd9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "306", "file_name": "pdfcoffee.com-the-youtube-formula-by-derral-eve.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/nguyenhoangquan/Documents/gate_sental/SENTAL/sental_app/app/streamlit_app/pages/data/pdfcoffee.com-the-youtube-formula-by-derral-eve.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5652085, "creation_date": "2024-10-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c603a360-8244-41d6-84b3-c656f1589c8b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "306", "file_name": "pdfcoffee.com-the-youtube-formula-by-derral-eve.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/nguyenhoangquan/Documents/gate_sental/SENTAL/sental_app/app/streamlit_app/pages/data/pdfcoffee.com-the-youtube-formula-by-derral-eve.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5652085, "creation_date": "2024-10-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-22"}, "hash": "282af6348ca7d84c3deb5eaa65c3d6a61358e5ebd7cb6667fa58e328b1e42581", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "306 ThIs Is No T Your Normal ackNowledgemeNT\nto stick with me over the years.
